<p>This experiment began on a rainy weekend in July. As I walked home through the rain, I thought back to my entry into the corporate world. At the time, summer sun was shining in October, and I'd just been hired by an ESN specializing in open-source web development. Some of their applications used the Plone CMS. I didn't know anything about it, so I tried to acquire some basic knowledge. I don't recall ever having managed to modify a theme in the proper way.</p>
<p>And so there I was, looking forward to getting home, when I was stopped in my tracks by an existential question: six years later, if I try to understand Plone again, what will it be like?  Can tools like ChatGPT, Copilot or Perplexity.AI help? Arriving home, I made myself a hot chocolate and make a break, considering whether the time I was going to invest in this experiment would be worthwhile. Given the amount of time I had available to carry it out, I decided to scale back my ambitions and start with Zope rather than tackle Plone directly. </p>
<h1>About my motivations</h1>
<p>I like the idea to discover Zope because it's a niche framework. The documentation is sufficient to use AI without reaching the threshold of abundance that would question its relevance. In fact, some of this documentation still concerns older versions of Zope. I know, from the outset, that my gen AI tools will run into difficulties that they won't encounter on more popular frameworks. So I'll be able to identify their limitations as well as their benefits.</p>
<p>Then let's talk about the objective. It's not about presenting you “my wonderful personal project” generated in half the time thanks to the “power of AI gen”. I want to participate to an open-source project, which means joining a community, understanding its expectations and codes, and proposing quality contributions that won't need to be develooped again, with or without AI. </p>
<p>Finally, get to grips with Zope is to meet a framework that will soon be celebrating its 10th anniversary. To understand how a project can achieve such longevity is to set off in search of ideas and practices from which we can all undoubtedly learn.</p>
<h1>Coming soon</h1>
<p>As I write these lines, I have no idea what conclusions I will draw from this experience. But I'm convinced that this feedback will give rise to qualitative exchanges on the real contribution of AI gen to our businesses.</p>                </article>
